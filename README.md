<p align="center">UI Component Playground </p>

This was built as I like to quickly have the same environment ready for any set of components that I build with and recreating the templates on codesandbox or something like codepen is a little more work and also I wanted to try out different approaches to a live snippet editor so this was born. It's no where close to perfect and was built for my use, if there's anything you'd like to add to it, feel free to fork / raise issues / raise PR's accordingly.

## Current Environment Defaults

- React components
- styled-jsx
- prettier (formatting)
- classNames (available as `cn` in the playground)


## To Be added 
- [ ] open color (literally a single line and a bit of testing, don't know what I'm waiting for.)
