<h1 align="center">Hen</h1>
<p align="center">UI Component Playground </p>

## Why?

Well I have moments where I'd like to try out new design ideas and stuff and setting up a boiler react app for that isn't the best choice, nor is doing it all on codepen either or storybook for that matter. Most of the times it's just jsx and a little bit of styling and the current version of hen suffices that requirement.

## Features

- React components
- styled-jsx
- prettier (formatting)
- classNames (available as `cn` in the playground)
