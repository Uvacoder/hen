## Motivation

It's easier to build components on something with predefined values that setting it up again and again so I setup this mini playground based on how I build react components , you can go ahead and use it or fork the repo to modify it to your likings

## Features

- CDN ESM Based, no need to wait for packages to install, native to how the browser imports modules
- Component Preview
- Distraction free code editor
- Code formatting
- Write in ES2020 and let babel take care of rendering it for you on the browser

## Contribute

The easiest way to contribute is to submit issues and pull requests for features that you'd like to see in the repo, you can fork the repo to make the solution more and more personalised
